    <div class ="col-md-4">
      My favourite color is <b id ="Color">blue</b>. Blue is a calm colour, the colour of the sea and the skies. When I think of how we're living in such a tranquil and beautiful world, I think of the colour blue.

      My Spiritual Animal is the <b id="Animal">sabre tooth tiger</b>. It's fierce, wild, and free (and also extinct but that's not why I love this animal so much).

      My favourite celebrity is Will Smith! From his spectacular performance in the amazing TV-Show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", to his even more spectacular performance at the Oscars. When I think of a celebrity that is my ideal role model, Will Smith, and Will Smith only, comes to mind!

      There is only one true amazing sport, and that sport, is ballet. Ballet-dancers are gracious, strong, and flexible. They excel at the aspects that most 'normal' athletes are only average at. The one thing that makes my testosterone flow through the roof, is a good ol' fashioned ballet-recital.

      My favourite fictional character is Frank Drebin. Who's Frank Drebin, you may ask? Well first of all, shame on you for never having seen 'The Naked Gun'. And second of all, Frank Drebin is the best detective in the world and the main character of the 'The Naked Gun' movie trilogy. Frank Drebin's quick wit, razor-sharp intellect, and keen eye for detail has saved the city more times than I can remember.

    <h2 class ="SlapTitle">Challenge Box: Clicker Edition!</h2>
    <p class ="ChallengeDescription">
      For this challenge, Oleksandr has to create a little click game right here. On every click the user does, the image of the clicker itself has to change. The amount of clicks also has to be visible. Once the user has more than 10 clicks, the page needs to change from lightmode, to darkmode. And once the user has 69 clicks, a sound-effect needs to be played. Good luck with everything man, can't wait to see how it will end up looking like!
