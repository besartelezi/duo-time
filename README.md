# What Time? Duo Time!
I have created a website about one of my fellow learners, Oleksandr. I have done all the HTML and CSS, and Oleksandr made all the JS on the page. [Click here to visit the page!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-pVZiRjac&ab_channel=KingdomHeartsFan3211)

## The Mission Very-Much-Possible
For this project, I had to be partnered up with someone, and then we had to make a page about each other, using only HTML and CSS. For the page, we have to a list of requirements of what we should write on the website about each other.
We can't ask each other about the needed information off the page, we should just take a guess and try to correctly guess the needed information. Then, we correct each other's pages using Javascript. </br>

So for example, I might guess that Oleksanders favourite sport is ballet, while it actually is football. He will use Javascript on the page I made about him to correct the information that I wrote down.

## Requirements
**One page of your partner with the following details:**
- [ ] it's responsive
- [x] it has a title
- [x] it has a favicon
- [ ] their favourite colour
- [ ] their spiritual animal
- [ ] their favourite sport
- [ ] their favourite fictional character
- [ ] their favourite celebrity
- [x] their picture (if you want to joke, be sure your partner is okay with it)
- [x] their name as a big header
- [ ] 3 words describing this person
- [ ] a challenge box
  * make a seperate section where your partner can unleash their creativity
  * challenge them to do something special
  * you can leave it empty or provide some html / img / css to help them out

**Your javascript fixing your partners HTML and CSS**

- [ ] Your description is accurate now
- [ ] The styling is how you prefer it to be
- [ ] If your partner forgot to add anything, you add it through js
- [ ] Take the challenge box from your partner and go crazy with it!
  * Try to take on the challenge from your partner
  * If this is too easy or too difficult, adapt it to your liking

## Nice to Have Features
* Nice-to-have features
* As many fun facts you can think of!
* SEO is good!
* Semantically correct
* CSS framework (bootstrap, tailwind, ...)
* Link to your partners page
* QR code linking to your / your partners page
  * we can print these and hang them around the campus!

## Challenge Box Ideas
* A box with a clicker on it, when the user clicks on that box 69 times, an audio file will play with the sound of a guy clicking his mouth and saying: "Nice."
  * The clicker itself will also change to something funny.

## Bootstrap-ped Up!
Another day, another chance to tackle Bootstrap head on until I understand it completely! I'm using this project as a chance to really understand the grid system that Bootstrap uses, to make everything as responsive as possible. I'd also like to take a crack at the flexbox that CSS uses, but I'll leave that for Future-Besart to figure out!

While creating the HTML, I'm trying to, quite literally, think inside the box. I need to place everything in an element, that's inside another element, **THAT'S** inside **ANOTHER** element. Caution! Working and thinking like this will result in your brain looking like it belongs in the popular game Minecraft.

## The Guessing Game
I'll be honest, I know very little to nothing about Oleksandr, and I'm terrible at reading people. So I'll just leave everything up to my imagination and that one psychology class I took once to guess the type of person Oleksandr is and where his interests lie.
